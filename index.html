what do you think of my resume

11:27 PM

Identified request for resume evaluation
Identified request for resume evaluation

Overall, this is a solid resume for someone early in their cybersecurity career — you've clearly put real effort into building practical experience through labs, CTFs, and certifications. Here's my honest take:

What's working well:

Your projects section is genuinely strong. The SOC Home Lab in particular shows hands-on initiative that a lot of candidates lack — you're not just listing tools, you're describing what you did with them (simulating attacks, triaging alerts, performing EDR response). That's the right approach and will stand out to hiring managers.

Your CTF placements (2nd at Ontario Cybersecurity Summit and BSides Toronto) are impressive achievements worth highlighting — some candidates bury these but they're real differentiators.

The GPA across both programs is excellent and worth keeping.

Areas to improve:

The resume targets Sobeys based on the filename, but nothing in the document is tailored to retail/corporate security. If you're applying to a specific company, try weaving in language that connects your skills to their context — things like POS security, retail fraud, or supply chain risk if relevant.

Your work experience bullets at GoodLife and Service Filtration are a bit generic. The IT printer fix and incident reports are fine, but try to quantify or sharpen the impact where possible. "Improved printing availability" is vague — what was the actual outcome?

The certifications section feels thin right now with just the Google cert. Once you're further into your degree, CompTIA Security+ or CySA+ would add weight here. You might also list any relevant coursework if your degree program covers things like network security or threat analysis.

Finally, consider adding a brief 2-3 line summary/objective at the top. You have no headline telling the reader who you are at a glance — something positioning you as a cybersecurity student with hands-on detection and incident response experience would help frame everything below it.

Overall though, for a student mid-degree, you're ahead of most. The practical projects and CTF wins show real commitment.

do you think recruiters would genuinely consider me

11:28 PM

Weighed candidacy prospects with candid evaluation
Weighed candidacy prospects with candid evaluation

Honestly? Yes, but with some realistic context depending on what role you're targeting.

For entry-level or junior SOC analyst roles, internships, or co-op positions, you're genuinely competitive. The combination of a hands-on home lab, real CTF placements, and a strong GPA puts you above a lot of students who only have coursework to show. Recruiters at companies actively hiring junior talent — MSSPs, financial institutions, government contractors — would likely give you a second look.

Where it gets harder is if you're targeting roles that list 2-3 years of experience as a baseline. Those postings often mean it even for "entry level," and without professional cybersecurity experience on your resume yet, you'd be screened out by automated filters before a human even sees it. That's not a reflection of your actual ability — it's just how a lot of applicant tracking systems work.

The honest gap right now is that your security experience is all self-directed or academic. That's genuinely valuable, but a recruiter at a larger company may want to see at least one professional security role, even a part-time or contract one. Your GoodLife job doesn't really bridge that gap.

A few things that would meaningfully improve your odds in the near term — a co-op or internship through Sheridan if available, CompTIA Security+ since it's a common filter in job postings, and applying directly through people rather than portals where possible given your club and CTF connections.

You're not a long shot. You just need one foot in the door and your profile builds quickly from there.

do position for intern really use ATS system, dont they know most of us really dont  have qualifications

Acknowledged the question's validity and prepared honest response
Acknowledged the question's validity and prepared honest response

That's a fair pushback, and you're partially right. Internship postings at smaller companies, local businesses, or roles you find through networking probably won't run you through a heavy ATS filter. A real person is more likely to actually read your resume in those cases.

But for internships at larger organizations — big banks, telecom companies, government agencies, large retailers — yes, ATS is still very much in play even for interns. Those companies post one internship and get 300+ applications, so they use filters to cut the pile down whether it's fair or not.

The more important thing you said though is that recruiters know students don't have qualifications. That's true, and it shifts what they're actually looking for. At the intern level they're less focused on years of experience and more looking for signals that you're genuinely interested and self-motivated — which your resume actually does well. The home lab and CTF wins are exactly the kind of thing that catches a recruiter's eye because most applicants just have their degree listed and nothing else.

So the realistic picture is that your resume is well-positioned for intern roles. The main thing working against you isn't the content — it's volume and competition. A lot of applications go nowhere simply because of timing, internal candidates, or budget freezes that get announced after the posting goes up.

The highest ROI move honestly isn't perfecting your resume further — it's getting it in front of people directly. Your CTF and club connections are underutilized assets. Someone you met at BSides Toronto or the Ontario Cybersecurity Summit is worth more than 50 cold applications through a portal.

what are the most intesting things you can do with claude free

Identified user inquiry regarding Claude's complimentary tier capabilities
Identified user inquiry regarding Claude's complimentary tier capabilities

Honestly there's quite a lot, here are some of the more interesting things people don't always realize they can do:

For someone in your field specifically, you can have Claude act as a mock interviewer for cybersecurity roles, ask you technical questions, and then give you detailed feedback on your answers. You can also describe a CTF challenge you're stuck on and work through it collaboratively.

Practical stuff that's genuinely useful:

You can upload documents and have Claude analyze them — like you just did with your resume. You can do this with PDFs, reports, anything you need broken down.

You can paste code or scripts and have Claude explain what they do line by line, which is great for learning malware analysis or understanding PowerShell scripts you encounter in labs.

You can ask Claude to explain complex topics at different depths — like have it explain how Kerberoasting works as if you're a beginner, then progressively go deeper in the same conversation.

More creative uses:

You can build surprisingly functional web apps, games, or tools through the Artifacts feature without writing code yourself. Claude generates interactive HTML/React components you can use directly in the browser.

You can also have Claude help you draft highly tailored cover letters, cold outreach messages to security professionals on LinkedIn, or even help you prep for Sheridan assignments.

The main limitation on free is just the message limits — you'll hit a cap during heavy usage and have to wait. For what you're doing as a student though, free covers most use cases pretty well.

can you completely redesingn my website and make it look what best for nowadays

Architected modern editorial design with distinctive typography and accent colors
Architected modern editorial design with distinctive typography and accent colors






I'll design something that feels genuinely 2025 — a bento grid layout with editorial typography and an acid green accent. No more generic cyan/purple hacker aesthetic. Let me build it.

Redesigned portfolio for Majd Abboud with 2025 bento grid aesthetic
index.html

Presented file
Done
Here's your redesigned portfolio. Here's what changed and why:

Design direction — Editorial Dark + Bento Grid. This is what top portfolios look like in 2025. Bento grids (the card mosaic layout) are everywhere on modern personal sites. I ditched the generic cyan/purple hacker aesthetic and went with an acid green accent instead — more distinctive and current.

Key upgrades:

Syne + JetBrains Mono typography instead of Inter — gives it a high-end editorial feel with a techy mono font for labels
Noise texture overlay for depth — subtle but adds a premium feel
Scroll reveal animations — cards fade in as you scroll
Hero stats bar — instantly shows your 3.75 GPA and 2× CTF wins before anyone reads a word
Lime-highlighted SentryPy card — makes your Python tool stand out
"Available for internships" badge at the top — signals to recruiters right away
One thing to note: your profile photo (IMG_4086.jpg) isn't included since I can only output the HTML. Just drop it in the same folder as the file and it'll show in the original version of the site if you add the image back to the hero section.
